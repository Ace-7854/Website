                I'm Ace
            </h4>
            <p>
            Hello I'm Ace also known as Edi.
            <br>
            Im a student in Computer Science A-levels based in the UK.
            <br>
            I've played games for a large sum of my life and so as a way to stick with my biggest hobby i'm aiming to get into programming.
             This sort of programming is not necessarily just making games but practical applications, which i do in c#, as well as web design (HTML and CSS of course).
            I have become quite accustomed to languages like c#, HTML and CSS, i do enjoy it alot. It is alot of fun for me to build something, while also keeping comfortable.
            <div class="container">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img src="images/Logo/Logo Standing.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Logo">
                        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light">
                            This image originated from space, with an asteroid.
                            <br>
                            What can i say.
                            <br>
                            Im just cool.
                        </figcaption>
                </figure>
             </div>
            It is also something i have come to reallly enjoy and love to experience. It is a great way to test resillience and i can tell you that for free. 
            Another thing i can tell you for free is the effort i put into these wacky things, it does not feel like a chore, by this i mean when i get home and contemplating what to do. 
            If i have an idea, it is most likely you will find me playing around very shortly. In my spare time i tend to do this just for my enjoyment.
            <br>
            Now stepping back a bit. The games. I played games since roughly seven(7) and it has gone on until now. 
            Playing games like puzzzle games to creative games to open world games and landing on fps (first-person-shooter) games.
            It has been alot of fun.
            <br>
            Thats the main lot of me. but other than that. ive just done small things and im not sad about it. 
            </p>
